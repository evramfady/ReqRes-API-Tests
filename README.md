# ReqRes-API-Tests
🧪 Automated API tests for ReqRes.in using Postman and Newman CLI.


## 🔍 Project Overview

This project contains automated API tests for [ReqRes.in](https://reqres.in), a demo REST API used for practicing HTTP requests.

The tests were created using **Postman** and executed via the **Newman CLI**, with full assertions, pre-request scripting, and collection-level variable chaining. A dynamic testing approach is applied using random UserIDs and chained validations across multiple requests.
